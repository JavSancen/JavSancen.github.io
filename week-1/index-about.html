    <div class="about">

        <p>I enrolled at BYU for an Applied Technology degree. <br> <br>

        I love to spend time playing or watching Disney movies with my wife and my daughter. I have nearly 3 years married and I have a 1 year and 7 months old daughter.<br><br>

        I'm working as a Market Research Specialist for a USA company I'm a specialist in Canadian vehicles. With my studies, I want to acquire the necessary experience in solving problems to get a Frontend Developer position this year.

        I'm very interested in learning web design because the internet is very interesting and is very interesting how something you can imagine can be built and shared in the air and then create an experience, it's amazing. I think there is a lot of work to do jet to build responsive and inclusive websites and this is the base to create on the internet, is amazing and it is because I'm here. In my personal life, I feel in logic and maths there are a lot of principles to learn when we create we feel part of the things our heavenly father feels and it is joy, that's because I feel here I found something to add to my personal life. <br> <br>

        I have twenty years as a member of the church I went baptized at eight years old for my grandfather. <br><br> My favorite quote is "The joy I feel has little to do with the circumstances of my life and everything to do with the focus of my life” <br> <b>-President Russell M. Nelson-.</b> <br> <br> My favorite scripture is "And now, if the Lord has such great power, and has wrought so many miracles among the children of men, how is it that he cannot instruct me, that I should build a ship?". <br>  <b>-1 Nephi 17:51-.</b>
    <br><br>
        I'm exyted to being here with all of you. Nice to meet you all.</p>
